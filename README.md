# PyBer_Analysis
Analysis of PyBer data by city type
# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the PyBer ride data by city type and determine how those differences can be used by PyBer Decision-makers.
# Results
### City Type Data

The differences between the data for the different city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) include the number of total rides, total drivers, total fare amounts, average fare per ride and driver. While the Rural city type has the lowest number of total drivers and rides, the average fare per ride and driver are higher than both of the other city types. This may indicate a further ride distance as the total fare amount is still significantly lower than the other city types. In urban cities, there are more drivers than total rides. This may be due to inactive drivers skewing the average fare per driver and can make PyBer less effective for its customers. 
### Total Fares by City Type

Urban and Rural city types have a steady up and down weekly pattern, but the Suburban city type is less predictable with an upward trend near the end of April where the other city types have a downward trend in April. All city types had a spike in weekly total fares in the third week of February. Both Urban and Suburban had a weekly total fare increase by the end of the provided data while Rural city types stayed within the 500 range.
# Summary
The differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types illustrate several business possibilities to address city type data disparities.  The first possibility is to attempt to increase the number of drivers in rural areas. If the ride distance is longer in rural areas an increase of drivers may increase the number of total rides and therefore total fares. Another option is to decrease the number of drivers in Urban cities by removing drivers that don't accept rides frequently. This can ensure that drivers remain active and are motivated to accept ride requests more frequently. This would even out the total ride count and driver count and increase the Average Fare per Driver. The third option is to increase advertising and raise awareness for Pyber in rural areas to increase customer base in those city types to insure an overall increase in total weekly fare.
